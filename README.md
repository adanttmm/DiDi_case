### DiDi_case
# Answers to BI challenge

As a first step I set up a MySQL database on my localhost, and tried to load the csv files into it. Here I noticed that the 'restaurants_visitors' file has corrupted data on the 'visit_date' column; since there's the 'visit_datetime' column and it has complete data, the missing rows can be recovered. Once this was done the file had no problems loading into the database and I was able to star working on the challenges.
